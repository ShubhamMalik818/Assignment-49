    "              directly proportional to the change in the independent variable.\n",
    "2. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all values of the independent variable. This means that the residuals are \n",
    "                     equally spread out around the regression line.\n",
    "3. Normality: The residuals are normally distributed. This means that the residuals are bell-shaped and symmetrical around the mean.\n",
